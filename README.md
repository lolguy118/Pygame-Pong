# Pygame Pong
### Hello world, this is a simple clone of the 1972 video game Pong with support for two player in the classic version. Additionally there is unique(ish) spin on the game in which the paddles have flappy bird physics aptly named flappy pong.
# Dependencies
### This game was made using Pygame. I found it to be really easy to understand and a great library for making games. Check out their [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/pygame) Just as a warning, removing or deleting a file from the assets or code folder will probably break the game.
### If you want to use Pygame, install it as such:
`pip install pygame`
# Gratitude
## Arts
### The play button and play again button were made by me in [PixilArt](https://pixilart.com/draw). However, the board, scorebar, paddles, and ball were all made by Esoe B. Studios. Many, many, thanks to them. Check them out on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCsuCNggL9EanhfPgvjyGEA), [GitHub](https://github.com/myebstudios), [Twitter](https://x.com/myebstudios), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/myebstudios), and [itch.io](https://myebstudios.itch.io/).

## Coding
### Clear Code's [Ultimate Introduction to Pygame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&t=10351s&pp=ygURcHlnYW1lIGNsZWFyIGNvZGU%3D) was on of the best tutorials I've watched and was super helpful.  I'd really be lost without him. His teaching style is really easy to follow alow with and makes learning that much smoother. Check out his [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@ClearCode) and his [GitHub](https://github.com/clear-code-projects). Eternally thankful to him for creating that video. I also used his [Pong in Pygame Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qf3-aDXG8q4&pp=ygULcHlnYW1lIHBvbmc%3D) to figure out how to make an AI and baraltech's [Pong in Pygame Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSZXroL4apY&pp=ygULcHlnYW1lIHBvbmc%3D) to learn the ball logic. Check him out on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@baraltech) and [GitHub](https://github.com/baraltech).
# Controls
### WASD for P1, Arrows for P2
# Modding(ish)
### I don't know why you would do this but if you want to make some custom paddles or replace the ball with Obama or something, just name the file the thing you want to replace. So if you want to replace the ball, just name the image Ball.png, drag it in, and replace the current Balll.png. I hope this helps.
# Thoughts
### Oh man oh man this could've been way better. Half way through making this I realized that I'd switched the positions of the player and computer images so that was a little bit of an oopsies on my end. I also couldn't figure how to get a decent AI for flappy pong that actually obeyed the physics of the game, so that was lovely. I also didn't use an ounce of OOP in this which probably would've made my code look a lot better. I think I will do just like a practice thing to make sure I can make a button class. I think next I'll take on Flappy Bird but I'll see where the wind takes me. Somethings on my list are some CS50 classes and University of Helsinkiâ€™s MOOC on Java.
# Updates
### Just updated the code to actually include a button class. It was pretty easy except some mishaps here and there.
